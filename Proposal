My final project will consist of a car game that will last 40 seconds long. The game will be one player only and the user is to crash all 
of the barrels before the time runs out. When the user comes in contact with the barrels, the barrels will disappear. If the time runs out,
the screen will show the words “Sorry, Time is Up”. If the user crashes all of the barrels before the time runs out, the screen will show 
“VICTORY, YOU WIN!!!”. A special feature that the game has is the choice of cars in which you can choose what car to play with. You choose
a car with the keys 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of those will give the user a different car such as 3 different convertibles and an ambulance. 
This game does not have any rules in specific except for not hacking the game in order to win. My ultimate goal for this game is to have a 
game that kind of causes anxiety, since you will be able to see that you are running out of time, but fun in a way that you will come back 
to play it. The different ways I am going to implement what I learned this year is an array for all of the barrel’s coordinates. Many 
conditionals for the four possible choices of cars, that is the ambulance, and three other convertible cars, and what words will show up 
depending on the events that occur during the game. I will use for loops and while loops so that the different words are popped up on the 
screen.
